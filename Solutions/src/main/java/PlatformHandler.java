 * Description:    Defines an interface that enables implementation of        *
 *                 support for new platforms. Each platform has a slightly    *
 *                 different way of doing things, e.g. I/O and expected       *
 *                 submission formats. This interface tries to encapsulate    *
 *                 perfectly the differences in behavior that exist between   *
 *                 those platforms, and lets the developers implement support *
 *                 for new ones easily.                                       *
