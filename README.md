# SolveKit
SolveKit aims to be a convenient runner and benchmarker for Java solutions to programming problems, with seamless integration into IntelliJ IDEA.

This repo is WIP as of the latest commit.

Planned platform support:
 * [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
 * [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
 * [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
 * [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/)*
 * [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/home)* ([Problem List](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder/#/table/))

`*`: The platform technically does not support Java 25, which is the language version that this project is configured to use. Make sure to stick to the language level supported by that platform.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo. Open its root dir in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. [Blah blah blah]

## LLM Disclaimer
Some Large Language Models (often incorrectly referred to as "artificial intelligence") were used to assist in the creation of this project.
 * IntelliJ IDEA's Inline Code Completion tool was used to speed up development. No original ideas were generated by this; it simply predicted what I was going to write and got it correct 60% of the time.
 * Other miscellaneous LLMs were used to quickly understand new things about Java that I did not know about before. I am a novice and I asked questions about best practices and how a professional would implement certain things. I then cross-checked that with other sources manually. **Large, contiguous blocks of code generated by LLMs are not present in this project.**

An LLM was never used to generate significant amounts of code that I already know how to write. I never copy-paste things from an LLM without thoroughly understanding the "thought process" behind it and the new code's implications.

**LLMs should never be asked to directly solve any problems originating from any programming puzzle site/contest. The creator of this project condemns such acts.**

All code in this repository was written by me, except libraries, the occasional Stack Overflow snippet (cited when appropriate), and the occasional LLM-produced trick. All is distributed under the [MIT License.](./LICENSE)
