# AoC in Java 25
This repository contains solutions I made for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems with Java 25.

I am doing AoC in Java even though I don't actually know/understand all the core data structures because as you know, the best way to learn flying is sitting in the cockpit, pushing buttons and turning knobs until something interesting happens.
###### ^ NEVER quote me on this in ANY context.

This repo is WIP. Latest completed solution: **2015 Day 5 Part 1**

### Disclaimer
Outside help was used to create these solutions, primarily Oracle's documentation and occasionally an LLM when a search engine couldn't understand my question properly. I also used an LLM to debug code that was behaving wrongly due to behavior that I didn't know existed in Java, e.g. 2015 Day 3, Part 1 where I was unknowingly passing a reference to an array rather than an array itself.
